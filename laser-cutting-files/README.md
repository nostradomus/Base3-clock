This folder contains all files required to laser-cut and engrave the plexi plates for the housing.

For the initial built, both 3 and 6 mm plexi material has been used.  

When using another thickness, the length of the srews and bolts should be adapted.

The .cdr-files have been created with CorelDraw, and have been optimized for [Trotec laser and engraving machines](https://www.troteclaser.com/en/). Three different RGB-colors have been used :

 - black : engraving
 - red : internal cut-outs
 - blue : outline cut
